### Streamlining SCCM/MECM Deployments with the Updated AD Group PowerShell GUI Tool

Managing deployments in SCCM/MECM can be complex, especially when working with AD groups. To simplify this process, I've developed a PowerShell-based GUI tool that automates application and package deployments, including creating and managing collections.

#### Key Features:

1. **Enhanced Deployment Capabilities**: 
   - The tool now supports both application and package deployments. It can create new collections, deploy apps and packages to them, or deploy to existing AD group collections.

2. **Automated Collection Management**:
   - Automatically adds collection variables and ensures that both apps and packages are placed in the correct folders within SCCM.

3. **User Collections**:
   - The tool now includes the ability to create user collections and deploy to them. Simply enable the "If user" checkbox to target user collections.

4. **Validation and Notifications**:
   - As before, the tool sends an email detailing the deployment for validation, ensuring that the right steps are followed before deployment.

5. **PowerShell Enhancements**:
   - The tool leverages PowerShell for adding and removing users from the admin group, ensuring a seamless deployment experience without unnecessary command prompt windows appearing on the desktop.

#### How It Works:

- **Create and Deploy**: The tool allows you to select an application or package, create a new collection if necessary, and deploy it with just a few clicks.
- **Folder Management**: Automatically organizes collections and deployments in SCCM, reducing the manual effort needed to maintain a clean environment.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The GUI is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for even those new to PowerShell or SCCM to use effectively.

#### Conclusion:

This updated tool significantly reduces the complexity of SCCM/MECM deployments, making it easier to manage applications, packages, and collections. With the added capability to handle user collections and the enhanced PowerShell backend, it’s a powerful addition to any admin’s toolkit.
